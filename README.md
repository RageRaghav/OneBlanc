## üõ∞Ô∏è API Integration

- Communicates with a backend server using **RESTful APIs** to fetch and update data.
- Uses **HTTP requests** (GET/POST) to retrieve:
  - Cuisine types  
  - Menu items  
  - Filtered dish results  
  - Order details and history
- Parses **JSON responses** and maps them to appropriate Dart models for smooth UI rendering.
- Implements **Provider** for efficient state management and data propagation across screens.
- Ensures consistent user experience by:
  - Updating UI reactively based on API responses  
  - Caching and managing state where needed
- Includes **basic error handling** for failed requests or invalid responses to avoid crashes and improve reliability.
- Designed to scale easily with additional API endpoints (e.g., authentication, real-time order tracking).
